        <h1>Graph Traversal in Data Structures</h1>
        
        <p>
            Graph traversal is a process used in data structures to visit and process each node in a graph systematically. Graphs can be represented as collections of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges, and there are two primary methods of traversal: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Each of these traversal techniques serves different purposes and is used depending on the type of graph structure and the requirements of the algorithm.
        </p>

        <h2>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h2>
        <p>
            Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal technique that explores as far along each branch as possible before backtracking. DFS is implemented using a stack, either implicitly through recursion or explicitly by using a stack data structure. DFS is useful in scenarios where the solution involves exploring deeply nested paths, such as in maze-solving algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps for Depth-First Search:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start at the root (or any arbitrary node in case of disconnected graphs).</li>
            <li>Mark the starting node as visited.</li>
            <li>Recursively visit each unvisited neighboring node, moving deeper into the graph until no further unvisited nodes are left.</li>
            <li>Backtrack to the previous node and repeat the process until all nodes are visited.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            DFS is often used in applications such as finding connected components, solving puzzles, and checking for cycles in a graph. Because of its depth-focused nature, it can quickly find a path to a solution in tree-like structures.
        </p>

        <h2>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>
        <p>
            Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a traversal method that explores all neighboring nodes at the current depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS is implemented using a queue, which ensures that nodes are visited in layers or levels. BFS is especially useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps for Breadth-First Search:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start at the root (or any arbitrary node in case of disconnected graphs).</li>
            <li>Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.</li>
            <li>Dequeue a node from the queue and visit each of its unvisited neighboring nodes.</li>
            <li>Mark each neighboring node as visited and enqueue it.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process until the queue is empty and all nodes have been visited.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            BFS is frequently used in applications where the shortest path or minimum moves are required, such as in GPS navigation, finding the shortest path in a maze, or in social network analysis.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Both DFS and BFS have unique advantages based on the needs of the traversal. DFS is depth-focused and suited for deep exploration and problems where backtracking is required, while BFS is layer-focused and ideal for finding the shortest paths in unweighted graphs. Understanding these traversal techniques is essential for effectively working with graphs and designing efficient algorithms.
