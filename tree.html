        <h1>Tree Traversal in Data Structures</h1>
        
        <p>
            Tree traversal is an essential technique used in data structures to access or manipulate the nodes of a tree in a specific order. Tree traversals are important in applications where data needs to be processed or analyzed in a hierarchical structure. There are several ways to traverse a tree, each of which serves different purposes based on the needs of the algorithm. The main types of tree traversal are In-Order, Pre-Order, and Post-Order traversal.
        </p>

        <h2>In-Order Traversal (Left, Root, Right)</h2>
        <p>
            In In-Order traversal, we follow the sequence: Left subtree, Root node, Right subtree. This traversal is particularly useful in binary search trees (BSTs), as it results in an ordered sequence of values from the tree. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps for In-Order Traversal:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visit the left subtree recursively.</li>
            <li>Visit the root node.</li>
            <li>Visit the right subtree recursively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For example, if we apply in-order traversal to a BST, it outputs the nodes in ascending order, making it ideal for situations where sorted output is required.
        </p>

        <h2>Pre-Order Traversal (Root, Left, Right)</h2>
        <p>
            In Pre-Order traversal, we visit nodes in the following order: Root node, Left subtree, Right subtree. This traversal is useful when we want to copy or duplicate a tree structure because it first processes the root and then the subtrees.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps for Pre-Order Traversal:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visit the root node.</li>
            <li>Visit the left subtree recursively.</li>
            <li>Visit the right subtree recursively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Pre-order traversal is helpful in applications where the nodes need to be processed before exploring the children, such as in prefix expressions or for creating a copy of the tree.
        </p>

        <h2>Post-Order Traversal (Left, Right, Root)</h2>
        <p>
            Post-Order traversal follows the order: Left subtree, Right subtree, Root node. This traversal is commonly used in applications where we need to delete or process the nodes in a “bottom-up” approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps for Post-Order Traversal:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visit the left subtree recursively.</li>
            <li>Visit the right subtree recursively.</li>
            <li>Visit the root node.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Post-order traversal is used in applications like deleting a tree, where each child node must be processed (or deleted) before the parent node. It is also used in evaluating postfix expressions.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Each traversal method has its unique use case and is applied based on the order in which nodes need to be accessed. In-Order traversal gives a sorted list in BSTs, Pre-Order is used for copying trees, and Post-Order is useful for deletion and bottom-up processing. Understanding these traversal methods is fundamental to working with tree structures in algorithms.
